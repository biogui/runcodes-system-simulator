Hi, I'm [Bio](https://github.com/biogui)!

And this is a script for [run.codes](https://we.run.codes/)' users to test their programs locally.

Thanks for testing, feedbacks are awesome! Feel free to contact me on telegram [here](https://t.me/gui_bio) :)

## **Features**
- ***Correct cases counting***, generating a result in relation to the total cases.

- ***Incremented diff checking***, made by comparing the output generated byte by byte with the expected output.

- ***Memory check***, made by using `valgrind` command, detailing bugs in relation to general memory usage.

## **Setup**
Make sure to:
- Have a recent ***python*** version[(3.x.x)](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installed.
- Have these commands installed in your terminal:
	- ***gcc*** - use `sudo apt install gcc`
	- ***valgrind*** - use `sudo apt install valgrind`
	- ***unzip*** - use `sudo apt install unzip`

After that, clone the repository and ***run setup.sh***:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ git clone https://github.com/biogui/runcodes-system-simulator.git ~/.rcsimulator`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ cd ~/.rcsimulator`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ sh setup.sh`

## **Usage**
Now, in any directory, just ***using the `rcsim` command***: `$ rcsim <flag> <prog-path> <tests-path>`

***ps.:*** *`rcsim` can be swapped by `python3 rcsimulator.py`, but it is necessary to have C in the current directory.*

#### **The `<flag>`**
This program treats different line endings (CR, LF, CR + LF) by default. In order to ignore that, use the `-i` flag.
- Using without flag:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ rcsim program.c Tests/`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Use example](/images/without_flag.jpg)

- Using with flag:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`$ rcsim -i program.c Tests/`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Use example](/images/with_flag.jpg)

#### **The `<prog-path>`**
This program suports a *single C program* or multiple files depending only on *Makefile* being included. In the `<prog-path>` field add the path to the .c file or Makefile.

#### **The `<tests-path>`**
This program suports both *ZIP archives* and *local directories* for the test cases. In the `<files-path>` field add the path to the .zip file or directory with the test-cases.

## **Notes**
- ***Prioritize running the simulator in the directory where your program or Makefile is***.
- ***Avoid killing the process during execution***. Unexpected stops end up not executing the file cleanup, which can generate problems in future processes. Processing may take longer for more complex programs, be patient.
- ***Pay attention to having your test cases organized in the directory or zip file you are using***. If there are other files with the tests, separate them, leaving a exclusive path for your tests. Beware of programs that deal with reading files, make sure they are in the proper directory before execution.
